\chapter{Basic definitions}

\begin{rem}
  First, let us properly introduce what a random walk is. After stating some of the basic definitions we will move to the core of this thesis which is to explore properties of occupation of a set times.
\end{rem}

\begin{defn}[Simple random walk in $\mathbb{Z}$]\label{defn-simple_random_walk_Z}
 Let $\{X_n\}_{n=0}^\pinf$ be a sequence of  \iid $\{-1,1\}$-valued random variables, that for some $p\in(0,1)$ and for $n\in \mathbb{N}$ satisfy $\pr \left( X_n=1 \right) =p$ and $\pr \left( X_n=-1 \right) =1-p=:q$.

 Let $S_0=0$ and $S_n=\suma[i][1][n]X_i$. We call the pair $ \left( \{S_n\}_{n=0}^\pinf, p \right) $ \emph{Simple random walk in $\mathbb{Z}$}.

 If $p=q=\h $, the pair $\left( \{S_n\}_{n=0}^\pinf, p \right)$ reduces to the element $\{S_n\}_{n=0}^\pinf$ which is called
\emph{Symmetric simple random walk in $\mathbb{Z}$}.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
 We often refer to $n$ as time, $X_i$ as the i-th step and $S_n$ is the position of the walk \intime $n$ or after $n$ steps.
 While talking about simple random walk in $\Z$ we say the i-th step was rightwards or more often upwards if $X_i=+1$ and that the i-th step was leftwards or downwards if $X_i=-1.$ If it is not stated otherwise, we will always assume that $S_0=0.$
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
  The most important characteristic of random walks is the probability of being in position $x$ \intime $n$.
  In order to calculate such probability we have to firstly find possible positions.

  For example, it is impossible for the random walk to be in position $x$ \intime $n$ if $x>n$ simply because there have not been enough steps to make it up to $x$. It is also impossible (given $S_0=0$) that after even number of steps the random walk is in odd-numbered position and vice versa. Therefore we define the set of possible positions.
\end{rem}

\begin{defn}[Set of possible positions]\label{defn-set_all_possible_values}
 \Lrw. We call the set $A_n=\{z \in \Z; \abs{z}\leq n, \frac{z+n}{2}\in \Z \}$ \emph{set of all possible positions} of random walk \rw\ \intime $n$.
\end{defn}


\begin{thm}[Probability of position $x$ \intime $n$]\label{thm-probability_position_time}
 \Lrw then for all $n \in \N$
 \[
 \pr \left( S_n=x \right) =
 \begin{cases}
 \binom{n}{\frac{n+x}{2}}p^{\frac{n+x}{2}}q^{\frac{n-x}{2}} & \text{for $x \in A_n$ },\\
 0, & \text{for $x \not\in A_n$}.
 \end{cases}
 \]

\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Consider random variables $X_{i}^{+}\dosad \indikator{X_i=1}$, and
   $X_{i}^{-}\dosad \indikator{X_i=-1}$, and define new random variables
   $R_n=\suma X_{i}^{+}, L_n=\suma X_{i}^{-}$.  The
   random variable $X_{i}^{+}$ can be interpreted as indicator
   whether i-th step was rightwards. Then, $R_n$ is number of
   rightwards steps and $L_n$ is number of leftwards steps. We can
   easily see that $R_n+L_n=n$ and $R_n-L_n=S_n$.  Therefore we get by
   adding these two equations $R_n=\frac{S_n+n}{2}.$

   Clearly, $X_{i}^{+}$ has alternative distribution with
   parameter $p$ (\textit{Alt(p)}). Hence, $R_n$ as a sum of \iid
   random variables with distribution \textit{Alt(p)} has binomial
   distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$ (\textit{Bi(n,p)}).
   Therefore we get
   $\pr \left(R_n=x \right) =\binom{n}{x}p^{x}q^{n-x}$, where we define
  binomial coefficients as statet in preface.
   Finally, for $a \in A_n$ we get
   \[
     \pr \left( S_n=x \right) =\pr\left( R_n=\frac{x+n}{2} \right) =
     \binom{n}{\frac{x+n}{2}}p^{\frac{n+x}{2}}q^{\frac{n-x}{2}}.
   \]
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
  Following are three simple lemmata that simplify many calculations in what follows. After proving them we can focus on the thesis goals.
\end{rem}

\begin{lemma}[Spatial homogeneity]\label{lemma-spatial_homogeneity}
  \Lrw\ and $n \in \N$ then for all $b,j \in \Z$
\[
  \pr \left( S_n=j \right) =\pr \left( S_n=j+b \mid
    S_0=b \right)
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} For any $j, b \in \mathbb Z$ holds
  \[
    \begin{split}
      \pr \left( S_n=j \right) & =\pr \left( \suma X_i=j
      \right)
      =\pr \left( \suma X_i=  \left(j+b\right)  - b \right) \\
      & =\pr \left( S_n=j+b \mid S_0=b \right).
    \end{split}
 \]
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[Temporal homogeneity]\label{lemma-temporal_homogeneity}
  \Lrw\ and $n,m \in \N.$ Then for all $j \in \Z$

   \[
     \pr \left( S_n=j \right) =\pr \left( S_{n+m}=j \mid
       S_m=0\right)
   \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} For any $j \in \mathbb Z$ and $m \in \mathbb N$
  \[
    \begin{split}
      \pr \left( S_n=j  \right) & =\pr \left( \suma X_i=j\right)
      =\pr \left( \suma[i][m+1][m+n]X_i=j \right)\\
      & =\pr \left( S_{n+m}=j \mid S_m=0 \right),
    \end{split}
  \]
where the second equality follows from identical distribution of
$\{X_n\}_{n=1}^{\pinf}.$
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Markov property]\label{lemma-markov_property}
 \Lrw $,n,m \in \N, n\geq m, a_i \in \Z, i\in \N$ such that $\pr \left(S_0=a_0, S_1=a_1, \ldots, S_m=a_m\right)>0$. Then
 \[
     \pr \left( S_n=j \mid S_0=a_0, S_1=a_1, \ldots, S_m=a_m \right)
     =\pr \left( S_n=j \mid S_m=a_m \right)
 \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 Because $\{X_n\}_{n=1}^\pinf$ is a sequence of independent variables, once $S_m$ is known, then the conditional distribution of $S_n$ depends only on steps ~\\$X_{m+1}, X_{m+2}, \ldots, X_n$ and therefore cannot depend on any information concerning values $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{m-1}$ and accordingly $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_{m-1}.$
\end{proof}
